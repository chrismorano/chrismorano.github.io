title: Finding Hidden Opportunities for Rio Tinto
subtitle: Helping the Mining Conglomerate Dig Deeper into their Data

<p class="lead">When Maiko Sell, a Senior Project Geoscientist with <a href="www.riotinto.com">Rio Tinto</a>, presented his proposal to our Master of Data Science class at the University of British Columbia, I was hooked.  Maiko is in charge of finding new opportunities at Rio Tinto and has become increasingly interested in leveraging data science techniques to help him do this.  Decision-makers in this industry are often asked to invest a king’s ransom on early-stage mining prospects based on very limited knowledge.  Given this fact, it seemed that there was enormous potential to contribute something of value that could be used to make better business decisions within the company.  I rated this project as my top choice and was grateful when I was assigned to work with Rio Tinto.</p> 

<p class="lead">Our group consisted of four Master’s students: Kitson Swann, Nada Salem, James Henry and myself.  One part of our project consisted of creating a dashboard in R Shiny that would combine two datasets (S&P’s drill results dataset and S&P’s resource and reserves dataset), visualize various metrics, and plot the drill results on a map of the Americas.  The dashboard we created was interactive, allowing users at Rio Tinto to see how drill results for chosen companies or projects compared to the overall distribution of results.  Users could choose which commodity to display, and subset results by date, by soil deposit type, and by the depth of the drill interval among many other options.</p>
