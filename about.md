Dr. Chris Morano received his Master of Data Science degree from the University of British Columbia in June 2017, only six months after finishing his Doctor of Musical Arts degree in piano performance.  (His doctoral thesis on three multimedia piano works can be found [here.](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0340648))  He's also a graduate of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois (Master of Music: piano) and Western University in London, Ontario (Hons. Bachelor of Music: piano).

Before becoming a data scientist, Chris was (and still is) an award-winning solo pianist, a sought after teacher and musical collaborator, and the co-founder of the [Ethos Collective](ethosmusic.ca).  This part of his career has taken a back-seat recently as he's been building his data science chops.

Looking to take his passion for analysis beyond musical scores (and, quite frankly, into a realm where in-depth analysis is more lucrative) he started a career change in 2014, taking courses at UBC and SFU in calculus, computer science, statistics, linear algebra, economics, and accounting.  A chance encounter with a neighbour changed his path from pursuing actuarial science to applying for the master's program in data science at UBC.  The rest is (recent) history.

Chris is now armed with a toolkit consisting of Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, keras), R (tidyverse, and many more libraries), SQL, Git, statistical and ML modelling, natural language processing, Shiny dashboard creation, eager curiosity, and a serious drive to accomplish something amazing.  Chris is currently working on side-projects, cleaning up his online presence, and looking for full-time employment.  If you are looking to hire a creative, responsible, and highly-analytical data scientist/analyst, please contact me by clicking the envelope on the bottom left.  If the work involves working with media or sound, that's not an area where I have much experience, but that's a direction in which I am interested in going.  I also speak German and French, if that's relevant to the job.

I would also love to hear from you if you are simply like-minded and want to reach out, or if you love/like/hate something I've posted on my blog.  Please feel free to send me links of things that you are working on that you think I might be interested in.  If they are cool and relevant, I'll add them to the links section of my site!
