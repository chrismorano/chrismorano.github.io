title: About Chris Morano

Dr. Chris Morano received his Master of Data Science degree from the University of British Columbia only six months after finishing his Doctor of Musical Arts degree in piano performance.  He's also a graduate of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois (Master of Music: piano), and Western University in London, Ontario (Hons. Bachelor of Music: piano).

Before becoming a data scientist, Chris was (and is) an award-winning solo pianist, a sought after teacher and musical collaborator, and the co-founder of the [Ethos Collective](ethosmusic.ca).  This career has taken a back-seat recently as he's been building his data science chops. 

Looking to take his passion for analysis beyond musical scores (and frankly into a realm where in-depth analysis is more lucrative!) he started his career change in 2014, revisiting calculus, computer science, statistics, linear algebra, economics, and accounting.  A chance encounter with a neighbour changed his path from pursuing actuarial science to the master's program in data science at UBC.  The rest is (recent) history.

With a toolkit consisting of Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, keras), R (tidyverse, and tons more), SQL, Git, statistical and ML modelling, natural language processing, Shiny dashboard creation, and eager curiosity, Chris is currently working on side-projects, cleaning up his online presence, and looking for work.  If you are looking to hire a creative, responsible, and high-analytical data scientist, data analyst, or data consultant, please contact me by clicking the envelope on the bottom left.  If the work involves working with media or sound, that is a bonus.  I also speak German and French, if that's relevant.
